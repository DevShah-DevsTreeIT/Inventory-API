```

üëâ Copy this value and send it in headers as:

```
X-CSRFToken: abc123...
```

### 2. **Register User**

```
POST /users/register/
```

Body (raw JSON):

```json
{
  "username": "testuser",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "msg": "User Successfully Registered",
  "id": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "name": "testuser"
  }
}
```

### 3. **Login User**

```
POST /users/login/
```

Body:

```json
{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

Response:

```json
{ "token": "jwt-token-here" }
```

üëâ Copy this JWT and send it in headers as:

```
Authorization: Bearer jwt-token-here
```

### 4. **Use APIs (with CSRF + JWT)**

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
  X-CSRFToken: <csrf>
  ```

  Body:

  ```json
  {
    "category": "Electronics",
    "category_descrip": "All electronic products"
  }
  ```

    "category": "Updated Electronics"
  }
  ```

* **Soft delete category**

## üìù Notes

* Always include both **JWT (`Authorization`)** and **CSRF token (`X-CSRFToken`)** for POST/PUT/DELETE.
* GET requests are **public** and don‚Äôt need authentication.
* Soft delete means items are not permanently removed; they are just marked as deleted.
